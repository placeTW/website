Taiwanese independence movements have existed since the 1680s, where under Qing rule the phrase 'Every three years an uprising, every five years a rebellion' became a common phrase. Though many observers point out that Taiwan is already an independent and sovereign country, this flag is also commonly used to rally those who are critical of the actions of the Kuomintang (KMT), especially under the era of martial law. The flag also represents movements for greater international recognition for Taiwan and the ending of threats to Taiwan's sovereignity. A common anthem of the Taiwanese independence movement is 'Taiwan the Formosa', particularly the first stanza.",
